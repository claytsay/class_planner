# `class_planner`

A web app designed to help college students plan their class 
schedules.


## Overview

As many college students know, planning one's classes can be a pain. UC
Berkeley provides a scheduling application called "College Scheduler"
(made by Civitas Learning) to help students. However, the system is a bit
clumsy to use and is not very user-friendly with regards to rapid
rearrangement/swapping of classes within a schedule.

**`class_planner`** aims to solve this issue by utilising a drag-and-drop
GUI that makes it easy for students to choose which classes they want to
include in their schedule.


## Technical Details

This app utilises [React](https://reactjs.org/) as its core technology,
originating as a `create-react-app` project.


## TODO

- [ ] Program the app to function correctly
  - [ ] Utilise the UC Berkeley Class API to get class information
- [ ] Create an intuitive, functional GUI
- [ ] Write a good [`README.md`](./README.md)
  - [ ] Reorganize the TODO list
- [ ] Clean up the code and files
- [ ] Maybe choose a better name for the app
